### World Bank Group - Women, Business and the Law Historical Data

The World Bank Group Women, Business and the Law (WBL) dataset is a comprehensive historical dataset that provides detailed information on the legal framework governing women's economic opportunities and rights.

The dataset defines a series of questions which are answered with YES or NO based on the country's legal framework. Those questions are grouped in the categories: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship, Assets, and Pension.

For each of the categories a score from 0 to 100 is calculated (Based on the percentage of questions answered with YES). Based on these scores, the WBL Index is calculated as the average of the scores of the categories.
