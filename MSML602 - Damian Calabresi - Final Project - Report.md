# The Correlation Between Democratic Governance and Women's Rights: A Global Analysis of Gender Equality in Democratic and Autocratic Regimes

## Abstract
Across the globe, the decline of democracy has been accompanied by a marked regression in women's rights, along with a broader reduction in human rights protections. Far-right political movements have gained traction, fueling a conservative ideological resurgence that challenges gender equality and often portrays feminist policies as threats to traditional societal structures. This ideological backslash affects not only women's rights but also the human rights framework that promotes equality and justice for all. On the other side, left-leaning governments, mostly formed during socialist and communist revolutions, implement profound changes in societal structures, human right policies, and public government access. This relationship between democracy and human rights, especially women's rights, was investigated while considering each country's cultural, religious, and economic values. This study found that women equality is directly related to the level of democracy in a country when considering countries from America, Europe, and Asia. This correlation is stronger when we analyze which countries provide a legal framework that brings women equality in a marriage to a man, when pension benefits are the same for both genders, countries with equal pay initiatives mandated by law, and those with maternity leave policies. The correlation is milder when analyzing countries from Africa or Oceania.

## I. Introduction
### A. Context

The second half of the 20th century saw significant progress in women’s rights, alongside the broader defense of human rights (Behr, Perrint, Hyland, & Trumbic, 2024). Over time, various achievements in different parts of the world led to both advances and setbacks in areas such as abortion rights, women’s suffrage and government representation, workplace equality, and seeking justice in cases of violence against women .

Some of the rights secured by feminist movements include mobility, freedom, and travel independence; anti-harassment and anti-discrimination protections in the workplace; equal pay for work of equal value; participation in the industrial workforce; equality in marriage and divorce laws; condemnation of domestic violence; maternity leave and protections for pregnant workers; access to credit and business participation; equal inheritance and administrative authority; recognition of non-monetary household contributions; access to pensions and retirement programs; and childcare benefits.

These achievements have often been realized in a select group of countries, typically those aligned with democratic and progressive values. Progress is neither linear nor guaranteed. The feminist movement has encountered setbacks during periods of cultural shifts, economic downturns, or a return to conservative governments.

The presence of checks and balances (Ortiz, Allen, Nagel, & Smith, 2023) among government branches is an important tool to protect human rights and promote equality in a civic society.

### B. Motivation

Over the last decade, a resurgence of conservative ideologies and authoritarian, populist leaders—predominantly from far-right backgrounds—has compromised these checks and balances while targeting feminist movements and women’s rights as part of broader campaigns against democratic principles and human rights protections (Grzebalska & Pető, 2018). This backlash manifests through:

* **Rhetorical Attacks**: Public discourse that undermines gender equality policies, often framing them as threats to traditional gender roles and family structures.  
* **Policy Regression**: Rollback of provisions related to gender equality, reproductive rights, and mechanisms safeguarding women against violence.  
* **Political Marginalization**: Attempts to diminish women’s political participation by promoting narratives that confine women to subordinate societal roles.

These ideologies usually consider themselves to act according to the democratic principles. However, there is no democracy when the participation of women is diminished. Throughout history, women’s rights have been closely tied to democratic stability, human rights protections, and the rule of law. On the other hand, the systemic erosion of these rights frequently signals broader democratic backsliding. While no democratic regime is entirely free from gender-based restrictions, the systematic regression of women’s rights under authoritarian rule stands as a critical indicator of democratic decline.

### C. Hypothesis

It's usually accepted that authoritarian regimes don't help the support of minorities and women, and democratic values are important to protect human rights. When comparing measurement of the level of democracy on each country, and the support for women's rights, we hypothesize that there is a correlation between the two.

We understand that to find a correlation across the globe, we need to consider the cultural, religious, and economic values of each country, as this relationship will be different on countries with distant cultures and traditions. We believe the religion and religious diversity of a country is a mild indicator of those cultural differences.

### D. Contribution

Existing literature has focused on the relationship between democracy and women rights without proper measurement and comparison of indicators. Those that have been done [1], search for global correlations without separating countries by continent, religion, or economic status.

## II. Literature Review

### A. Previous Work

Behr,Daniela Monika; Perrin,Caroline Sabine Marie; Hyland,Marie Caitriona; Trumbic,Tea. Empowering Change : Assessing the Role of Democracy, Civil Society, and Women’s Rights Groups in Advancing Legal Gender Equality (English). Policy Research working paper ; no. WPS 10788; PEOPLE; RRR Washington, D.C. : World Bank Group. http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099741306032438849 https://doi.org/10.60572/aqdz-9671

The research includes an exhaustive analysis of the laws and regulations created on each country over the years and how they affect 8 legal indicators of women's equality. They translated the legal framework of 190 countries into 8 measurements. The research analyzes women's legal rights across eight domains: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship, Assets, and Pension.
The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the role and importance of active civil society organizations and women's rights groups in advancing legal gender equality.
The results reveal that higher levels of democracy and a more active civil society are positively associated with advances in legal equality between men and women.

The investigation didn't find significant correlation between the levels of democracy found in the Polity5 dataset and the 8 legal indicators of women's equality, except for the Workplace predictor.

The analysis doesn't consider other confounding factors in this relationship, like regional, cultural, or religious differences.

## III. Methodology

#### 1. Women, Business and the Law

This dataset is provided by the World Bank Group and it's based on the law framework of each country. It evaluates a series of yes or no questions based on the available laws. The questions are grouped in eight sections: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship, Assets, and Pension. Each section provides a score based on the number of positive answers. The WBL Index is the sum of all the sections.

#### 2. Women Peace and Security Index

Developed by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, this dataset is based on surveys. It defines a series of predictors and the value is based on the number of women that provided a positive answer. Is based on three dimensions: Inclusion, Justice, and Security.

#### 3. The Polity Project

Developed by the Center for Systemic Peace, this dataset is based on expert assessments. It analyzes eight basic features of a democracy and provides a score from 0 to 10 for the autocracy, democracy, and polity levels, being polity the combination of democracy and autocracy.

#### 4. Freedom in the World

Created by Freedom House. It analyzes political and civil rights since 2013. It groups a series of questions in 7 categories. Each category contains 3 to 4 questions and provides a score from 0 to 4, being 4 the highest score. The Total democracy index is the sum of all the categories.

#### 5. Lexical Index of Electoral Democracy (LIED)

Created by the Harvard Dataverse. It analyzes the electoral system of each country and provides a score from 0 to 10 for the electoral democracy index.

#### 6. Boix-Miller-Rosato Dichotomous Coding of Democracy

Created by the Harvard Dataverse. It analyzes the democratic system of each country and contains a Yes or No value to indicate if a country is democratic or not.

#### 7. Religious Diversity Index (RDI)

Provided by the Pew Research Center. It contains the population of each country and the number of people that practice each religion, classified by these categories: Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Unaffiliated, Folk, Others. It calculates a Religious Diversity Index (RDI) for each country using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.

### B. Data Analysis

#### 1. Data Cleaning

The datasets were transformed to tabular format with one row per country. In the case of time-series datasets, the latest year was selected. Numeric values were transformed to numeric columns. Number of records with missing values was analyzed. The countries for which records were missing are regions, territories not formally recognized as independent states or those that don't exist anymore. These cases were removed from the analysis. Some typos were found in the country names and years, those were corrected. Column names were normalized to use lowercase and underscores.

In the case of the Polity dataset, the countries without sovereignty were removed, as those contain special numeric values.

Countries in the datasets were identified using the Correlates of War (COW), V-Dem, and ISO3166-1 codes. All the countries in the datasets were mapped to the ISO3166-1 Alpha-3 codes. Non-matching countries were analyzed manually and mapped to the corresponding country.

In the case of the Religious Diversity Index, the percentage of population for each religion was provided. A boolean predictor was created to identify if a country has a majority of a specific religion.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Almost all the datasets contain a composite index with an overall score for democracy or women's rights, which is calculated using the other columns of the dataset. As the correlation is forced, we removed such predictors and run a PCA with the remaining ones. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the most important predictors on each dataset and which ones add more variance to the model, to prioritize them in the next steps. The results are shown in the following figures:

![1-pca-polity.png](report-images/1-pca-polity.png)

![2-pca-freedom-in-the-world.png](report-images/2-pca-freedom-in-the-world.png)

![3-pca-lied.png](report-images/3-pca-lied.png)

![4-pca-georgetown.png](report-images/4-pca-georgetown.png)

![5-pca-world-bank.png](report-images/5-pca-world-bank.png)

The coefficients of the first and second principal components of each dataset show that all the predictors are almost equally important and they cannot be discarded.

A correlation matrix was created for each dataset to identify if specific predictors deemed a specific analysis or understand if the overall score could be used when comparing datasets.

![6-corr-polity.png](report-images/6-corr-polity.png)

![7-corr-freedom-in-the-world.png](report-images/7-corr-freedom-in-the-world.png)

![8-corr-georgetown.png](report-images/8-corr-georgetown.png)

The predictors of the Women Peace and Security Index which are not correlated with the rest will require a special consideration during the analysis.

We run a linear regression for each dataset to verify that predictors are correlated with the overall score. As expected, given the correlation enforced by the calculation, all the predictors added similar value to the global predictor.

We analyzed the relationship between the majority religion feature generated before in the Religious Diversity Index dataset and the religious diversity score itself. This demonstrated that countries with Christian and Muslim majorities are not so diverse.

![table-1-rdi-regression.png](report-images/table-1-rdi-regression.png)

#### 3. Democracy Index Comparison

We compared the global scores of the democracy index of each dataset. The results are shown in the following figure:

![2-democracy-index-comparison.png](report-images/2-democracy-index-comparison.png)

This correlation matrix demonstrates that all the datasets are highly correlated, meaning that any of them can be used to find a correlation with the other datasets. The Freedom in the World dataset is the one that brings more detailed information, with more categories and a more granular analysis ("total" score in the correlation matrix). It has a correlation of 0.77 with the "democracy" score of the Dichotomous Coding of Democracy dataset, considering that the second one is a dichotomous variable, this is a strong correlation. We decided to use the Freedom in the World dataset for analysis that require a continuous variable and the Dichotomous Coding of Democracy dataset for the binary analysis.

### C. Implementation

#### 1. Modeling techniques

Three different techniques were used for modeling.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to analyze the relationship between democratic and non-democratic countries visually and identify patterns. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data allow the SVM algorithm to provide a visual representation of the data.

Linear Regression and LASSO were used for quantitative analysis of the relationship between women's rights and democracy. This algorithm provides numerical results and a measure of significance for each predictor. Before the execution of regression models the predictors were normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Hierarchical Clustering was used to group countries based on their democracy index as well as women's rights indicators and do a visual interpretation of the results.

#### 2. Assumptions

Given the previous analysis of the dataset and the high correlation between predictors in the datasets, we assumed that the main indicator of each category can be used for the comparison. To give an example, the Women, Business and the Law dataset provides a score for each of the 8 categories, and the WBL Index is the sum of all of them. We decided to use these eight categories for the comparison.

Freedom in the World dataset provides the best granularity and detail on the democracy index. The correlation matrix demonstrates that the "total" score of this dataset is the best indicator of a democracy.

The Dichotomous Coding of Democracy dataset provides a binary value for each country, being 1 a democracy and 0 a non-democracy. We use this dataset in place of the Freedom in the World dataset for the binary analysis with the SVM algorithm.

#### 3. Performance evaluation

SVM algorithm results were evaluated visually and corroborated with linear regression results.

Linear Regression and LASSO were evaluated using the R-squared and the p-values of the coefficients. P-values below 0.05 were considered significant. R-squared above 0.5 is considered enough to define that a correlation exists.

#### 4. Feature selection

Linear Regression demonstrated which predictors were significant for the correlation. Among those features categorized as significant, the ones with higher coefficients were selected for the final analysis. When Linear Regression provided similar coefficients for multiple features, a LASSO regression was run to force the selection of the most important features.

The Georgetown datasets demonstrated a high correlation that occured because the source of these datasets is very similar and countries with more economic development will score higher in the Women Peace and Security Index despite the differences between men and women in the given society.

The analysis of the Women, Business and the Law dataset demonstrated the the most important features to predict the democracy of a country are: Marriage, Pension, Pay, and Parenthood.

#### 5. Data enrichment and segmentation

The democracy dataset, Freedom in the World, was merged with the "Women Peace and Security Index" and the "Women, Business and the Law" datasets. This dataset was then merge with the "Religious Diversity Index" to have a more detailed analysis of the relationship between religion and democracy. The Continent was added to the final version of the dataset for a more comprehensive segmentation.

During the analysis, correlation was examined for countries that belong to specific continents or with specific majority religions. Based on this segmentation it was decided to run a separate analysis on three datasets, classified by:
- America, Europe, and Asia
- Africa and Oceania
- Countries with Muslim majority

## IV. Results and Discussion

### A. Results

#### 1. Women Peace and Security Index vs Freedom in the World

The correlation between the Women Peace and Security Index and the Freedom in the World democracy index is shown in the following figure:

![10-wps-correlation.png](report-images/10-wps-correlation.png)

The correlation of specific fields like "access_to_justice", the WPS index, and "financial_inclusion" is strong and visually represented. Deeper analysis of the dataset and the origin of the data demonstrated that the Women Peace and Security Index conducts surveys to gather the data, which don't compare the situation of men and women in the same country. For example, the "access_to_justice" is defined based on how many women replied feeling safe to go to the justice, but this is mostly correlated with the overall judiciary system of the country, not the situation of women, which is strictly related to the democracy levels.

#### 2. Women, Business and the Law vs Democracy

Support Vector Machine run on the Women, Business and the Law and the Freedom in the World datasets is shown in the following figure:

![11-wbl-svm.png](report-images/11-wbl-svm.png)

Linear, Radial, and Polynomial kernels were used to run the SVM algorithm. The best results were obtained with the Radial kernel. The confusion matrix for these kernels is shown here:

![12-wbl-svm-conf.png](report-images/12-wbl-svm-conf.png).

The following countries are identified as false positives:

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Russian Federation, Republic of Belarus, Republic of Armenia, Republic of Azerbaijan, Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Republic of Liberia, Togolese Republic, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Gabonese Republic, Central African Republic, Republic of Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Republic of Rwanda, Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Republic of Angola, Republic of Mozambique, Republic of Zambia, Republic of Zimbabwe, Republic of Namibia, Republic of Seychelles, United Arab Emirates, Republic of Tajikistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Uzbekistan, Republic of Kazakhstan, People's Republic of China, Kingdom of Bhutan, Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, Kingdom of Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Republic of Singapore, Solomon Islands, Republic of Fiji, Kingdom of Tonga, Independent State of Samoa

#### 3. Women, Business and the Law and Religious Diversity Index vs Democracy

The Religious Diversity Index predictor and the features indicating the majority religion of each country were added to the dataset. The following figure shows the correlation between the Women, Business and the Law index and the Democracy index:

![13-wbl-rdi-svm.png](report-images/13-wbl-rdi-svm.png)

Including the RDI information generates a cluster in the PCA generated data. This new cluster is formed by countries with a majority of Christian population.

Running the SVM algorithm classifying the countries by relation provided the following results:

![14-wbl-by-religion-svm-conf.png](report-images/14-wbl-by-religion-svm-conf.png)

The democratic and non-democratic countries show a better separation with this segmentation. Still, the confusion matrix shows that there are some countries that are identified as false positives.

![15-wbl-by-religion-conf.png](report-images/15-wbl-by-religion-conf.png)

The linear regression results are shown in the following figure:

![table-2-wbl-rdi-regression.png](report-images/table-2-wbl-rdi-regression.png)

The R-squared is 0.455 and the p-values are below 0.05 for pay, marriage, and pension.

The following figure shows the linear regression considering each predictor for Christian, Muslim, or other countries:

![table-3-wbl-rdi-regression-by-religion.png](report-images/table-3-wbl-rdi-regression-by-religion.png)

The R-squared improves to 0.625 and the p-values are below 0.05 for WBL Index, Christian majority, Pay, Marriage, Pension, and Parenthood.

The linear regression limited to those countries without Christian or Muslim majority is shown in the following figure:

![table-4-wbl-rdi-regression-by-religion-no-christian-or-muslim.png](report-images/table-4-wbl-rdi-regression-by-religion-no-christian-or-muslim.png)

In this case the R-squared goes up to 0.704 and the p-values are below 0.05 for parenthood, assets, and pension.

The analysis of the outliers based on the Studentized Residuals provides the following results:

![table-5-wbl-rdi-outliers.png](report-images/table-5-wbl-rdi-outliers.png)

The linear regression limited to only Christian majority countries decreases the R-squared to 0.463. When run for countries with Muslim majority the R-squared is 0.388.

#### 4. Women, Business and the Law, Continents, and Religious Diversity Index vs Democracy

Continent information was added to the dataset and the SVM algorithm was run again for different segmentations. The following figure shows the SVM results when the dataset is segmented by: countries of America, Europe, and Asia; countries of Africa and Oceania; and countries with Muslim majority:

![16-wbl-by-continent-svm.png](report-images/16-wbl-by-continent-svm.png)

#### 5. Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering was run for the Freedom in the World dataset. The following figure shows the dendrogram:

![17-freedom-in-the-world-dendrogram.png](report-images/17-freedom-in-the-world-dendrogram.png)

The distance threshold was set to 10 to generate 3 clusters.

A Hierarchical Clustering was also run for the Women, Business and the Law dataset. The following figure shows the dendrogram:

![18-wbl-dendrogram.png](report-images/18-wbl-dendrogram.png)

The distance threshold was set to 5 to generate 5 different clusters.

A world map was generated to visualize the clusters on each dataset and simplify the visual interpretation of the results.

![19-fw-map.png](report-images/19-fw-map.png)

![20-wbl-map.png](report-images/20-wbl-map.png)

### B. Discussion

#### 1. Correlation between Women's rights and Democracy

The SVM analysis demonstrated that the Women, Business and the Law dataset is a decent indicator of democracy. The linear regression results confirm that the Women's rights dataset is positively related to democracy levels but the R-squared is low. All the predictors from the Women, Business and the Law dataset are significant and they're highly correlated, but the most significant ones are marriage, pension, pay, and parenthood.

Segmentation of the dataset by continent and majority religion showed that the relationship between women's rights and democracy is strong in countries with higher religious diversity, not Christian or Muslim majority. Countries with Christian majority have a lower correlation between women's rights and democracy. If the country is of Muslim majority, the correlation is even lower.

Countries in Africa and Oceania experiment a much lower correlation. When the analysis is isolated to countries in America, Europe, and Asia, the hypothesis is confirmed: the better the situation of women in the country demonstrate higer levels of democracy.

#### 2. Outliers

The analysis of the outliers based on the Studentized Residuals as well as in the SVM's confusion matrix shows two patterns of countries that are commonly missidentified:
- Countries that were recently a democracy and maintained law that promote women equality, like Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Belarus
- Countries from Africa and Oceania

#### 3. Unexpected results and discoveries

The discovery of a majority of outliers in Oceania was unexpected based on the cases known to the group.

Countries which were not Christian, like those with Unaffiliated or Folk majority, have surprisingly higher levels of democracy, religious diversity and correlation between women's rights and democracy.

#### 4. Biases and limitations

The analysis was limited to the datasets available and the analysis was focused on the relationship between women's rights and democracy. Other important factors were not considered, like the level of development of the country, the level of education, and the level of income inequality. The use of the continent and religion dataset was a simple approximation to segment countries with different cultural backgrounds.

## V. Conclusion

From the analysis we understand that the level of women's rights and equality supported by a country legal framework is a decent indicator of democracy. This correlation is stronger when countries from different regions are analyzed separately.

This is not true for countries from Africa and Oceania, or countries with Muslim majority.

## VI. Future Work

Future work will require the analysis of time-series data already provided by the datasets collected for this investigation. The time based analysis will allow us to understand what comes first, the variations in democracy or women's rights, and to understand the causality of the relationship.
