## 1 - Dataset Extraction and Research

## Goal

Transform all the raw datasets from complex Excel or Data files to CSV files. Normalize the column names and remove unnecessary columns.

Shift time series data to have years as rows.

Document and describe the meaning of each column/predictor.

See [1-dataset-cleanup/README.md](1-dataset-cleanup/README.md) for details.

See [1-dataset-cleanup/dataset-extraction.ipynb](1-dataset-cleanup/dataset-extraction.ipynb) for the code.
