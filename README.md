## 1 - Dataset Extraction, Cleanup, and Research

### Goal

Transform all the raw datasets from complex Excel or Data files to CSV files. Normalize the column names and remove unnecessary columns.

Shift time series data to have years as rows.

Document and describe the meaning of each column/predictor.

Fix empty rows and NaN values.

Descriptive analysis of the datasets, define scope and properties to analyze.

See [1-dataset-cleanup/README.md](1-dataset-cleanup/README.md) for details.

See [1-dataset-cleanup/dataset-extraction.ipynb](1-dataset-cleanup/dataset-extraction.ipynb) for the code.

## 2 - EDA and Scope Definition

See [2-eda-scope-definition/README.md](2-eda-scope-definition/README.md) for details.
